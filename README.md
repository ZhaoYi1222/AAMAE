## Dataset

Due to the large volume of data, we are looking for a suitable publishing platform. 

The dataset structure and description are as follows.

We introduce STSSD, a large-scale RS dataset designed for spatial-temporal-spectral unified SSL. 
This dataset is meticulously curated through data pruning from an initial pool of 4.2 million original images collected at 1,045K sampling locations. 
The resulting STSSD comprises 510K image sets, each containing up to six images collected from two sources with different resolutions and spectral compositions. 
STSSD consists of 4 kinds of image sets, featuring diverse sources, spatial resolutions, coverage, and acquisition times.
